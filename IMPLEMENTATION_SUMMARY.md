# GDMC MCP Server Implementation Summary

This document summarizes the implementation of the GDMC MCP server, which provides a bridge between the FastMCP framework and the GDPC (Generative Design Python Client) for Minecraft.

## Implemented Features

### Tools

1. **place_block**
   - Places a block at specified coordinates
   - Supports block states and block entity data

2. **run_command**
   - Executes Minecraft commands
   - Returns command results

3. **place_cuboid**
   - Places solid or hollow cuboids
   - Supports custom block types

4. **analyze_terrain**
   - Uses world slices and heightmaps to analyze terrain
   - Provides statistics, terrain profiles, and surface block information
   - Identifies terrain features like height range and water presence

5. **build_with_transform**
   - Builds structures with transformations (rotation and flipping)
   - Supports multiple structure types: house, tower, bridge, well, garden
   - Customizable size and block types

6. **create_and_place_model**
   - Creates complex models: tower, tree, fountain, statue, windmill
   - Customizable height, width, and block types
   - Uses GDPC's Model class for efficient building

7. **place_entities**
   - Places entities in the world
   - Supports random distribution within a radius
   - Customizable entity type and count

### Resources

1. **gdmc://build_area**
   - Returns the current build area information

2. **gdmc://players**
   - Returns information about online players

3. **gdmc://minecraft_version**
   - Returns the Minecraft server version

4. **gdmc://block/{x}/{y}/{z}**
   - Returns block information at specific coordinates

5. **gdmc://biome/{x}/{y}/{z}**
   - Returns biome information at specific coordinates

## Architecture

The implementation follows the FastMCP architecture pattern:

1. **Lifespan Management**
   - Creates and manages the GDPC Editor instance
   - Handles connection errors and buffer flushing

2. **Tool Implementation**
   - Each tool is implemented as an async function
   - Uses anyio.to_thread.run_sync for running synchronous GDPC operations
   - Proper error handling and context logging

3. **Resource Implementation**
   - Resources provide read-only access to world data
   - URI templates for parameterized resources

4. **Helper Functions**
   - Structure building functions for different building types
   - Model creation functions for different model types

## Client Example

A client example (src/client_example.py) demonstrates how to use the MCP server programmatically:
- Connecting to the server
- Accessing resources
- Using tools with various parameters
- Handling results

## Future Enhancements

Potential future enhancements could include:
1. Support for world slice caching across multiple requests
2. More advanced terrain analysis and adaptation
3. Integration with AI for procedural generation
4. Support for importing and exporting structures
5. Performance optimizations for large-scale building operations

## Dependencies

- GDPC >= 8.1.0
- FastMCP
- PyGLM (via GDPC)
- NumPy (for terrain analysis)
