FastMCP GDMC Bridge Client Example

This script demonstrates how to connect to the GDMC Bridge MCP server
and interact with a Minecraft world through the GDPC library.

Usage:
    python src/client.py         # Normal mode (requires Minecraft with GDMC HTTP interface)
    python src/client.py --test  # Test mode (connection test only, no Minecraft required)

Requirements:
    - fastmcp>=2.0.0
    - gdpc>=8.1.0

Known Issues:
    - Block retrieval fails with 'Block' object has no attribute 'model_dump'
    - Command execution may fail with "'NoneType' object is not iterable"
    
    These issues are related to compatibility between the GDPC library and FastMCP
    and will be addressed in future updates.
